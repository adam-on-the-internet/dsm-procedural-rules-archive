        - Update readme
        - Get version listing from assets or db, not from Constants?
        - Collab to take more comments on rule change context?
        - v11 to v1?
        - Other ideas?
        - Rule changes also include:
            - enforcement (and how it changes, is selected)
            - stuff beyond code (banning people, threats, muting)
            - city hall changes (no water, metal detectors, private security)
