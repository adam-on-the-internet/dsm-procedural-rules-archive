## Current Rules

The City of Des Moines refuses to make their City Council Procedural Rules public, 
so we have transcribed a copy of the rules we obtained and added some additional information.

The transcription was taken from a less-friendly PDF document (obtained through a FOIA request in November 2021).

## DSM City Code

The "Procedural Rules" are not City Code. 
City Code is modified through Ordinances. 
City Code Section 2.70 applies to meetings as well. 
The City Code is publicly available, 
and also contains text about the City's legal ability to cite alleged rule-breakers.
