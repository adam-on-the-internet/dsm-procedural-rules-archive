## Current Rules

The City of Des Moines refuses to make their City Council Procedural Rules public, 
so we have transcribed a copy of the rules we obtained and added some additional information.

The transcription was built using city documents (PDFs) and other information from council meetings.
We hope this format is more accessible.

### Des Moines City Code

The "Procedural Rules" are not City Code. 
City Code is modified through Ordinances. 
City Code Section 2.70 applies to meetings as well. 
The City Code is publicly available, 
and also contains text about the City's legal ability to cite alleged rule-breakers.

### Iowa Open Meetings Code

The state of Iowa also has "Open Meetings" code that applies to these meetings.
