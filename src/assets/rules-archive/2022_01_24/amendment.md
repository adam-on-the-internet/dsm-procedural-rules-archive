## Rule 28. Manner of Addressing Council

### Difference 

-

### Before

At each regular 
Council meeting, if any requests to speak have been received, a 
person desiring to address the Council shall step to the podium, 
state one’s address, and group affiliation (if any) and speak 
clearly into the microphone.  In lieu of providing a current 
residential address at the time of speaking during any non-public
hearing item at the meeting, a person may provide one’s 
address via email, written mail, or other writing to the City 
Clerk on or after the date ten days preceding the meeting but 
prior to 3:00 P.M. on the day of the meeting at which the 
requester desires to speak.

If the person has provided a 
current address to the City Clerk as required herein and the 
City Clerk has verified this address, then the person desiring 
to speak shall only be required to provide one’s name, zip code 
and ward residency at the time of speaking. At all public 
hearings, however, each speaker at each hearing that is a party 
in interest shall be required to provide one’s name, address, 
and group affiliation (if any).

All other speakers may, if an 
address previously was provided to the City Clerk, only be 
required to provide one’ name, zip code and ward residency at 
the time of speaking.  If the meeting is entirely electronic, 
the person shall use the prescribed method for comments, but 
shall not speak on the same item more than once.  If the meeting 
is not entirely electronic, then only those persons in 
attendance at the physical location of the meeting will be 
permitted to speak and only in accordance with these rules and 
the City Code.  The person shall follow these rules and the 
direction of the presiding officer at all times.

Except as herein provided

via email, written mail or other writing to the City Clerk to

majority vote, shall be considered separately and not as a portion
of any motion calling for action upon the remainder of the "Consent
Agenda". The City Clerk, on all matters contained in the "Consent
Agenda" shall record the yes and no votes on each item separately
