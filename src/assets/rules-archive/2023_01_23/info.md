## Summary

Council severely limited the processes for Council Members to request items for addition on City Council Agendas.

The rule is overly complicated to the point of it being unclear to the public how the rule actually would operate.

Additionally, the amended rule seems to violate Iowa Open Meetings Law by requiring a majority vote to accept or deny a Council Request outside of an Open Meeting.

From the city's own resolution text, this rule change is intended to allow the city to "arrange its Agenda to promote ... orderliness and efficiency", clearly stating that the city considers bringing an item up for discussion or vote before council has already made consensus is not orderly and efficient. This shows the city expects majority consensus entirely outside of council meetings, flaunting Iowa Open Meetings Law around majorities.

The Rule Change was sponsored by Mayor Cownie and Mayor Pro Tem Boesen.

### Before the 1/23/23 Meeting

At the October 3, 2022 Regular Meeting, DSM City Council had item 68-I for a Council Request of a Work Session Topic involving Abortion Protections.
This came after Mandelbaum had pushed Council to consider such action around the overturning of Roe v Wade and anticipation of Iowa GOP criminalizing abortion.

The Mayor (and others) had declined to allow this discussion at City Hall and, per Rule 11, had given Mandelbaum a final chance at discussion by requesting a work session topic at a regular meeting.

Prior to the 10/3/22 council meeting, council received many emails for and against action on this topic from Planned Parenthood advocates and Anti-Abortion activists.

At the meeting, council members attacked Mandelbaum and refused to allow certain aspects of discussion of this item.
Much of the discussion happened with euphisms (without actually referring to Abortion or the item in question).

Mandelbaum's request was rejected and the vote was clearly rushed. People against Mandelbaum resorted widely to lies about his proposal itself, and the vote. 
The proposal itself was very limited and the vote was about whether to consider discussing his proposal at a work session, not whether to implement his proposal.
Council members claimed to want alternatives, but shot down any chance at alternatives by refusing to discuss alternatives at a work session.

Planned Parenthood activists and Anti-Abortion activists were both present at this meeting, and City Manager Scott Sanders and Police Chief Dana Wingert brought the METRO STAR team (SWAT police) to the meeting as a result, closing off an accessible entrance to the building to accomodate the police.

No public comment was allowed.

### At the 1/23/23 Meeting

At the 1/23/23 Meeting, council sought to immediately vote on this rule change without discussion or summary explanation.

Mandelbaum and Sheumaker managed to assert their dissent anyway, and made many crucial points about how bad this rule change was and how it continued to whittle away at Democratic Processes in city government (a pattern with DSM council rule changes).

Public comment was not allowed.

### After the 1/23/23 Meeting

As of 2/5/23, the official updated council rules have not been made public via the city's website.

While implementation is unclear, the rule itself suggests that Des Moines city council members are now constantly at risk of openly violating Iowa's open meeting laws by taking a council vote (to pass/fail majority) outside of an open meeting.

### Other Notes

This rule change was almost exactly one year after the previous rule change, which had similarly been retaliation against a council member.
In that rule change, broad changes were made to limit the power of single council members and the public.
Council members responsible for the rule change admitted the objective was to limit Sheumaker's power after she used basic processes to call for a 24/7 Winter Warming Shelter in Des Moines and was shut-out, in part by Mandelbaum.
Councillor Boesen was a sponsor on both that rule change and this rule change.

This is the second rule change that targets Mandelbaum, and both were done in similar fashions.
Rules Version #13 was established on May 10, 2021 in apparent retaliation against Mandelbaum attempting to bring items about policing on the City agenda for discussion and vote.
