## Appendix B - Attachment: Electronic Meetings

### May 21, 1986

WHEREAS, electronic participation by absent City Council
members fully comports with the policy considerations underlying
Chapter 21 of the Iowa Code, the Iowa Legislature's Open Meetings
Law, the purpose of which is to assure that the City's decision
making occurs in public session to which all members of the public
are afforded participatory access to the extent reasonably
possible; and

WHEREAS, there are many issues where because of the statutory
voting requirements, or the importance of the subject matter to
the public, it is necessary or desirable to arrange for
participation of as many of the council members as possible even
through a majority but not all members can be physically present
at the meeting; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED, by the City Council of the City of Des Moines,
Iowa:

That it shall be the local rule of this City Council to secure
electronic participation by absent members whenever it is
physically feasible where such participation is necessary or
desirable because of statutory voting requirements or the
importance of the subject matter to the public.

Moved by Szymoniak to adopt.

FORM APPROVED:

Nelda Barrow Mickle

Acting Corporation Counsel

## Appendix C - City Code Section 2-70: Meetings

Des Moines City Code is available at [municode](https://library.municode.com/ia/des_moines/codes/code_of_ordinances).

The City Code is separate from the Procedural Rules. The Procedural Rules are adopted and amended through Resolution action. City Code is modified through Ordinances.

### (a) Time, procedure.

Regular meetings of the council shall be held on the dates set forth in a schedule of meetings adopted by the council, at a time to be set by the council. Special meetings may be called from time to time by the mayor or a majority of the members of the council. Notice of the meeting shall be given personally or left at the usual place of residence of each member of the council, and a record of the service of notice shall be made by the clerk. All meetings of the council, whether regular or special, shall be held in accordance with the state public meetings law, I.C. § 21.1 et seq., or other appropriate provision of state law. If, at any meeting, the presiding officer of the council is not present, the mayor pro tem shall act as the presiding officer pro tempore of the meeting, and the mayor pro tem's acts shall have the same force and legality as though performed by the regularly elected presiding officer of the council. In the absence of both, the council shall select a presiding officer for the meeting.

### (b) Holidays. 

When any legal holiday shall fall on Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, the regular meeting of the council shall be held at such time and place as may be designated by resolution of the council.

### (c) Rules of conduct. 

The following rules are adopted for the conduct of those attending regular and special meetings of the city council in the council chamber in the city hall:

#### (1)

No person shall be permitted to stand in the council chamber during council sessions between the audience seats and the councilmembers except the persons addressing the council, who shall do so from the speaker's stand, and except city officials and employees on city business.

#### (2)

No person shall enter the raised area at the west end of the council chamber or the area used by the city clerk, except upon invitation of the council or a member thereof, and except city officials and employees on city business.

#### (3)

No person shall enter the raised area at the east end of the council chamber except representatives or employees of the communications media.

#### (4)

Any person desiring to address the council may do so when recognized by the presiding officer, but the council reserves the right to limit the speaker's time and the order in which the speakers may address the council.

#### (5)

No person shall be interrupted while addressing the council except by a member of the council.

#### (6)

No member of the public shall be permitted to sit or lean upon the council table during sessions of the council.

#### (7)

No person shall use unreasonably loud or abusive language or any other language in the council chamber which disrupts or is intended to disrupt the peace, quiet, and good order of a council meeting.

#### (8)

Those having business before the council shall have the right to speak to items as they appear on the council agenda, subject to the constraints in subsections (c)(1) through (7) of this section.

#### (9)

Any person who violates any of the rules of conduct set out in this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine as provided by section 1-15 of this Code or shall be guilty of a municipal infraction punishable by a civil penalty as provided by section 1-15 of this Code.

#### (10)

The chief of police shall enforce this subsection and upon request shall provide sufficient officers therefor.
