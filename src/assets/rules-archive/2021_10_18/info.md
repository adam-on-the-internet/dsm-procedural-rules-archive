## Summary

In previous meetings, the Des Moines City Council inconsistently required speakers to provide their 
residential address before speaking in accordance with a long-standing rule. 
This was challenged by members of the public
as a safety concern for speakers
(especially domestic violence survivors), 
as an exlusionary concern for people without addresses (such as houseless folks), 
as a free speech concern (the requirement makes people more hesitant to speak),
and as a broadly discriminatory concern (since this requirement was applied inconsistently).

After a few meetings where the public directly challenged this requirement when speakers chose not to speak
rather than state their address publicly, the Council made this rule change. 
This rule change allows folks to say their Ward and ZIP Code rather than their full address, 
as long as the City had previously verified their address (the process for this was unclear).

This was a positive step, though requiring address verification still excludes houseless folks.
